            Hyderabadi chicken biryani is an aromatic, mouth watering and authentic Indian dish with succulent chicken
            in layers of fluffy rice, fragrant spices and fried onions. It is easier than most recipes while retaining
            the original taste and presented step by step. Cook like a native but with more ease!

        <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
        <div>
            <ol class='OrderedList'>
                <li >
                    Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until brown. Remove to a paper
                    towel-lined plate to drain and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet and fry onions, garlic, and fresh ginger until onion
                    is soft and golden. Add chili, pepper, turmeric, cumin, salt, and tomatoes. Fry, stirring
                    constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook
                    over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary
                    to add a little hot water if the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
                <li>When mixture is thick and smooth, add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low
                    heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left
                    when the chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the
                    gravy.</li>
                <li>To prepare rice: Wash rice well and drain in colander for at least 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot. When the mixture is hot, pour it over the rice and stir well.
                    Add the chicken mixture and potatoes; gently mix them into the rice. Bring to boil. Cover the
                    saucepan tightly, turn heat to very low, and steam for 20 minutes. Do not lift lid or stir while
                    cooking. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
