            Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical
            lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients,
            such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.

        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
                    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel
                    seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for
                    about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to
                    10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with
                    egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6
                    noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a
                    third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with
                    1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover
                    with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not
                    touch the cheese.</li>
